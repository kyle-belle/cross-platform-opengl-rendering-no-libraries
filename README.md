# This code is very messy

# Should not even be considered for any sort of use by anyone viewing this

# TODO:
* Create COLLADA file loader <br/>
* Implement animation <br />
* Bring Windows implementation of windowing code upto date <br />
* Create native windowing implementation for MacOS <br />
* Clean code by removing comments of old code (probably should do this soon) <br />
* Rename all classes so they begin with capital leters <br />

note: <br />
    There is a Mac branch which attempts to use XQuartz and X11 but it is way behind as XQuartz only supports opengl 2.1 and GLSL #120.<br/>
    Will attempt to create native windowing for mac some time in the future.
